# Fiberart-webshop

> The project is a webshop for <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/andthread?ref=nla_listing_details">&thread wall hangings</a>. 

I've created this single page web app as the final project for a workshop, with the goal to besides technologies learned in the workshop, learn and use additional tools to create a fully functioning webstite.
